# Omniwatch

## General

Omniwatch provides a set of utilities to aid cluster administrators or
individual application developers to aggregate scale-out system
metrics via low-overhead sampling across all hosts in a cluster or,
alternatively on a subset of hosts associated with a specific user
job. Omniwatch infrastructure can aid in the collection of key
telemetry from AMD Instinctâ„¢ accelerators (on a per-GPU
basis). Relevant target metrics include:

* GPU utilization (occupancy)
* High-bandwidth memory (HBM) usage
* GPU power
* GPU temperature
* GPU clock frequency (Mhz)
* GPU memory clock frequency (Mhz)
* GPU throttling events

The data can be scraped for detailed visualization and analysis via
a combination of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and
[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).


For more information on available features and installation steps
please refer to the online [documentation](https://amdresearch.github.io/omniwatch/).
