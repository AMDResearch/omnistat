# Omnistat

## General

Omnistat provides a set of utilities to aid cluster administrators or
individual application developers to aggregate scale-out system
metrics via low-overhead sampling across all hosts in a cluster or,
alternatively on a subset of hosts associated with a specific user
job. Omnistat infrastructure can aid in the collection of key
telemetry from AMD Instinctâ„¢ accelerators (on a per-GPU
basis). Relevant target metrics include:

* GPU utilization (occupancy)
* High-bandwidth memory (HBM) usage
* GPU power
* GPU temperature
* GPU clock frequency
* GPU memory clock frequency
* GPU block error counts
* GPU throttling events
* Inventory information
  * ROCm driver version
  * GPU type
  * GPU vBIOS version

The data can be scraped for detailed visualization and analysis via a
combination of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) /
[VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics)
and [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). Users can also
generate PDF reports summarizing resource utilization on a per job
basis with SLURM entirely in user-space.


For more information on available features and installation steps
please refer to the online [documentation](https://amdresearch.github.io/omnistat/).
