This subdirectory houses the input markup for Omnistat documentation using
Sphinx. The results are published automatically via a CI trigger at:

https://amdresearch.github.io/omnistat/

You can build a local copy of the documentation in this directory using
"make html" assuming you have the necessary sphinx dependencies installed.

The base python dependencies for documentation builds are housed in
requirements-docs.txt. In addition, the Makefile relies on the
sphinx-build binary which also needs to be available locally.
