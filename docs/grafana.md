# Grafana Dashboards

Dashboards allow cluster telemetry data to be visualized interactively in near
real-time. Omnistat provides several sample [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
dashboards for cluster-wide deployments that vary depending on whether resource
manager integration is desired or not (screenshots of the variants with
resource manager integration enabled are highlighted in [Example
Screenshots](#example-screenshots)). JSON sources for example dashboards that
can be used in local deployments are highlighted below. Note that in addition
to querying GPU data gathered with the Omnistat data collector, these example
dashboards assume that
[node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) data is also being
collected.

- *RMS* dashboards provide integration with *Resource Managers* like
  SLURM.
  - [Global Dashboard](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omnistat/blob/main/grafana/json-models/rms-global.json):
    provides an overview of the system, cluster-level telemetry for allocated
    and unallocated nodes, and job indices.
  - [Node Dashboard](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omnistat/blob/main/grafana/json-models/rms-node.json):
    job allocation timeline and detailed metrics for a single node in the
    cluster.
  - [Job Dashboard](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omnistat/blob/main/grafana/json-models/rms-job.json):
    provides detailed time-series data, load distribution, and other metrics for
    a single job.
- *Standalone* dashboards are meant to work without a resource manager.
  - [Global Dashboard](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omnistat/blob/main/grafana/json-models/standalone-global.json):
    provides an overview of the system and cluster-level telemetry.
  - [Node Dashboard](https://github.com/AMDResearch/omnistat/blob/main/grafana/json-models/standalone-node.json):
    detailed metrics for a single node in the cluster.


## Grafana server

To visualize Omnistat's monitoring data, Grafana needs to be installed and
configured to use the Prometheus server described in the [system-wide
installation](installation/system-install).

### Installation

The official Grafana documentation describes several ways to [install
Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/),
including using packages for major operating systems.

Connectivity between Grafana server and Prometheus server is required to
display Omnistat data, so Grafana is typically installed and runs on an
administrative host.  If the host chosen to support the Prometheus server can
route out externally, you can also leverage public Grafana Cloud infrastructure
and
[forward](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/tasks/collect-prometheus-metrics/)
system telemetry data to an external Grafana instance.


```{note}
We recommend the official documentation for production systems. However, if you
are only interested in testing the dashboards, you can use the [Grafana Docker
image](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/docker/).
For example, run a temporary Grafana container with the following command, load
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser, and then follow the
steps below to configure the Grafana server and import dashboards.

```shell-session
docker run -e GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true -e GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin -e GF_USERS_DEFAULT_THEME=light -it --rm -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

### Data source

The Prometheus server configured as part of the [Omnistat
installation](installation/system-install) needs to be added to Grafana as a
new data source.

To add a data source to Grafana:
1. Click **Connections** in the left-side menu.
2. Enter "Prometheus" in the search dialog, and click the **Prometheus** button
   under the search box.
3. Configure the new Prometehus data source following instructions and provide
   the hostname and port where Omnistat's Prometheus server is running.

## Import dashboards

To import a dashboard to an existing Grafana server:
1. Click **Dashboards** in the left-side menu.
2. Click **New** and select **New Dashboard** from the drop-down menu.
3. On the dashboard, click **+ Add visualization**.
4. Upload the dashboard JSON file.
   ```eval_rst
   .. figure:: images/grafana-import-dashboard.png

   ```

Sample dashboards are configured using standard default values for settings
such as network ports, but may require changes depending on the environment.
The following variables represent the most relevant dashboard settings:
- `source`: Name of the Prometheus data source where the data is stored.
   Defaults to `prometheus`, and may require filtering if the Grafana instance
   has several Prometheus data sources.
- `node_exporter_port`: Port of the Prometheus Node Exporter. Defaults to `9100`.

To configure a dashboard:
1. Open a dashboard in edit mode.
2. Click **Dashboard settings** located at the top of the page.
3. Click **Variables**.
4. Click the desired variable and update its value.
