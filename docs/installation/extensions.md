# Building optional components

```eval_rst

Omnistat includes two optional components that can be built and installed to
provide additional data collector capabilities.

1. [Hardware counters](#hardware-counters)
2. [Tracing](#tracing)

Both rely on C++ compilations via `cmake` and additional instructions for each optional component
are outlined below.

## Hardware Counters

The ROCprofiler extension provides access to low-level GPU hardware counters
for in-depth performance analysis. There are different ways to build and
install this extension depending on how Omnistat is installed.

### Install with setuptools

This method builds the extension in-place, without installing an Omnistat package.
```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install cmake-build-extension nanobind

# Build and install extension in place
BUILD_ROCPROFILER_SDK_EXTENSION=1 python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Install with pip

This method builds the extension and installs Omnistat as a package.
```bash
BUILD_ROCPROFILER_SDK_EXTENSION=1 pip install .[query]
```

With a **`venv`** virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv ~/venv/omnistat
BUILD_ROCPROFILER_SDK_EXTENSION=1 ~/venv/omnistat/bin/python -m pip install .[query]
```

## Tracing

The tracing extension is a standalone C++ shared library
(`libomnistat_trace.so`) that instruments a GPU application at runtime. It
provides two independent trace streams:

- **Kernel dispatches**: per-kernel timing and execution metrics.
- **RCCL communication**: collective enumeration (operation, message size,
  datatype) and communicator creation.

Unlike the ROCprofiler extension above, it does not require a Python build
step. A single build produces both streams; which ones are active at runtime is
controlled by environment variables described in [Tracing
metrics](../metrics.md#tracing).

### Requirements

- ROCm 6.4+
- C++20 compiler
- CMake 3.15+

```{note}
The build automatically fetches the header-only
[cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) library (used to send
trace data over HTTP) via CMake's `FetchContent`, along with the
[fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library if the compiler does not support
`std::format`. For offline builds, download the source trees ahead of time and
point CMake at them:

    cmake -S rocprofiler-sdk/ -B build-trace/ -DBUILD_KERNEL_TRACE_LIB=ON \
      -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_HTTPLIB=/path/to/cpp-httplib \
      -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_FMT=/path/to/fmt
```

### Build

```bash
cmake -S rocprofiler-sdk/ -B build-trace/ -DBUILD_KERNEL_TRACE_LIB=ON
cmake --build build-trace/
```

The resulting library is located at `build-trace/libomnistat_trace.so`. See
[Tracing metrics](../metrics.md#tracing) for usage instructions.
