# This entrypoint script performs the final installation of Omnistat and
# executes all the appropriate daemons. Valid commands for this script are:
#  - controller-system
#  - node-system
#  - controller-user
#  - node-user
#
# Installation is the same both modes: system and user. However, some
# daemons like the Prometheus Server and Omnistat Monitor are only configured
# and started when running in system mode.
